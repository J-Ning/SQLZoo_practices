# SQLZoo_practices
This repository contains a curated set of SQL queries completed as part of my practice on [SQLZoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net/). The queries are grouped by topic to demonstrate mastery of fundamental SQL concepts.

**Skills Used:**
- Data selection and filtering with WHERE
- Table joins (INNER, LEFT, SELF JOIN)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Grouping and filtering with GROUP BY and HAVING
- Nested and correlated subqueries
- Handling edge cases using NULL
